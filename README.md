# Syringe vacuum extractor
Low-cost redesign of device for vacuum assisted delivery (Also EgAr-device)

## Problem
Why we need a new design for vacuum extraction in low resource settings?
Currently the malmstrom vacuum extractor is commonly used and in a few cases the KIWI is used as a tool.

'''The Malmstrom'''
* Is fit for sterilization. 
* Is not user friendly.
* Often has parts missing and often has leaking tubes.

'''The KIWI'''
* Is designed for one time use.
* Isn't designed to be sterilized.
* Costs approximately 40 dollars
* Is user friendly.

Currently tropical doctors from Europe supply hospitals with second hand KIWI\'s. Hospitals in low resource settings do not have the funds to spend [http://mnhtech.org/uploads/Forcepts%20and%20Vacuum.pdf 40 dollars] on a single vacuum extraction procedure. Due to lack of funds they also wish to re-use the devices. KIWI's need to be sterilized to make this possible and it isn't designed for that. They are being used 4 to 5 times and they are sterilized as thoroughly as possible. As a result there is a contamination risk. Also the performance of the KIWI deteriorates over time as it was designed for one time usage.

## Demands for a new vacuum extractor
*Designed for multiple use
*Fit for sterilization
*Low cost per single use (well below 40 dollars)
*At least as user friendly as the Kiwi

## Case
Vacuum extraction isn't used often anymore in most African countries. Probably because of fear of contamination, lack of knowledge and skill, lack of the right equipment and fear of injuring the mother and/or child. In the Netherlands however, 10% of new borns are delivered using this method. Vacuum extraction can be an alternative to a Cesarian section, the advantages:
*Less complications for the mother and child
*Cheaper and faster for the hospital
*Not using vacuum extraction can also results in still births.
When there are complications during labor a vacuum extractor can speed op the process faster compared to a Cesarian section. If the process takes too long the risk of still births or newborns with permanent handicaps increases. Currently vacuum extraction is being introduced again in a hospital in Kampala, Uganda. This is initiated by a tropical doctor from the Netherlands. Research is conducted to determine the influence of the method on the amount of Cesarian sections and the health of the mother and child.

## Solution
Together with Arfang and We are working on a Syringe vacuum extractor.
